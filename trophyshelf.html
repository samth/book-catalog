                                            <span class="description">Molecular Biology of the Cell is the classic in-dept text reference in cell biology. By extracting the fundamental concepts from this enormous and ever-growing field, the authors tell the story of cell biology, and create a coherent framework through which non-expert readers may approach the subject. Written in clear and concise language, and beautifully illustrated, the book is enjoyable to read, and it provides a clear sense of the excitement of modern biology. Molecular Biology of the Cell sets forth the current understanding of cell biology (completely updated as of Autumn 2001), and it explores the intriguing implications and possibilities of the great deal that remains unknown. The hallmark features of previous editions continue in the Fourth Edition. The book is designed with a clean and open, single-column layout. The art program maintains a completely consistent format and style, and includes over 1,600 photographs, electron micrographs, and original drawings by the authors. Clear and concise concept headings introduce each section. Every chapter contains extensive references. Most important, every chapter has been subjected to a rigorous, collaborative revision process where, in addition to incorporating comments from expert reviewers, each co-author reads and reviews the other authors' prose. The result is a truly integrated work with a single authorial voice. Features : - Places the latest hot topics sensibly in context - including genomics, protein structure, array technology, stem cells and genetics diseases. - Incorporates and emphasises new genomic data. - All of molecular biology is brought together into one section (chapters 4-7) covering classically defined molecular biology and molecular genetics. - Two chapters deal exclusively with methods and contain information on the latest tools and techniques. - New chapters on "Pathogens, Infection, and Innate Immunity". - Cell Biology Interactive CD-ROM is packaged with every copy of the book. - Contains over 1,600 illustrations, electron micrographs and photographs, of which over 1,000 are originally conceived by the authors.</span>

It provides a sound basis for understanding random motions of molecules, subcellular particles, or cells, or of processes that depend on such motion or are markedly affected by it. Readers do not need to understand thermodynamics in order to acquire a knowledge of the physics involved in diffusion, sedimentation, electrophoresis, chromatography, and cell motility—subjects that become lively and immediate when the author discusses them in terms of random walks of individual particles.</span>

The first few chapters introduce the general principles of protein structure both for novices and for non-specialists needing a primer. Subsequent chapters use specific examples of proteins to show how they fulfill a wide variety of biological functions. The book ends with chapters on the experimental approach to determining and predicting protein structure, as well as engineering new proteins to modify their functions.</span>

Beginning with simple theoretical models and experimental techniques, Protein NMR Spectroscopy develops the complete repertoire of theoretical principles and experimental techniques necessary for understanding and implementing the most sophisticated NMR experiments.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Important new techniques and applications of NMR spectroscopy have emerged since the first edition of this extremely successful book was published in 1996. The second edition includes new sections describing measurement and use of residual dipolar coupling constants for structure determination, TROSY and deuterium labeling for application to large macromolecules, and experimental techniques for characterizing conformational dynamics. In addition, the treatments of instrumentation and signal acquisition, field gradients, multidimensional spectroscopy, and structure calculation are updated and enhanced.<br />

Modern NMR spectroscopy is a highly developed, yet still evolving, subject which has applications in chemistry, biology, medicine, materials science and geology. In this text, emphasis is on the more recently developed methods of solution-state NMR applicable to chemical research, which are chosen for their wide applicability and robustness. These have, in many cases, already become established techniques in NMR laboratories, in both academic and industrial establishments. A considerable amount of information and guidance is given on the implementation and execution of the techniques described in this book.</span>

                                            <span class="description">Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is an enormously powerful and versatile physical method for investigating the structure and dynamics of molecules. This text provides a clear, concise introduction to the physical principles of NMR, and the interactions that determine the appearance of NMR spectra. It describes and explains how nuclear spins interact with a magnetic field (the chemical shift) and with each other (spin-spin coupling); how NMR spectra are affected by chemical equilibria (exchange) and molecular motion (relaxation); and concludes with an outline of the workings of some simple one- and two-dimensional Fourier transform NMR experiments. The ways in which NMR may be used to study the structures, motions and reactions of molecules are illustrated and discussed. Only essential mathematics and theory are presented. The emphasis throughout is on understanding the basic principles.</span>

                                            <span class="description">This book provides a concise, approachable description of how modern NMR experiments work, aimed principally at those who use, or might use, an NMR spectrometer and are curious about why the spectra look the way they do. It provides, in an accessible and relatively informal fashion, the conceptual and theoretical tools needed to understand the inner workings of some of the most important multi-pulse, multi-nuclear, multi-dimensional techniques that chemists and biochemists use to probe the structures and dynamics of molecules in liquids.<br />

                                                Part A (chapters 1-6) starts with the vector model, and proceeds to the more powerful product operator formalism. Part B (chapters 7-10) shows how straightforward quantum mechanics can be used to understand NMR and product operators at a more fundamental level.<br />

Since the previous (second) edition was published in 2000, the structures of the bacterial and eukaryotic ribosomes have been published, advancing our basic understanding of translation and mechanisms involving protein and RNA regulators. In addition, as the title indicates, this edition has a new focus on the role of translational control in human development and disease. This book, with 30 chapters written by experts in the field, is essential reading for anyone interested in the process of translation, its regulation, and how its failure can be the cause of disease.

It prepares students for their future courses and careers by introducing the statistical methods most often used in medical literature. Rosner minimizes the amount of mathematical formulation (algebra-based) while still giving complete explanations of all the important concepts. As in previous editions, a major strength of this book is that every new concept is developed systematically through completely worked out examples from current medical research problems.</span>

The bark of the Pacific yew tree produces Taxol, found to be a highly effective drug against ovarian and breast cancer. Taxol blocks mitosis during eukaryotic cell division. The supply of Taxol from the Pacific yew tree is vanishingly small, however. A single 100-year-old tree provides only about one dose of the drug (roughly 300 mg). For this reason, as well as the spectacular molecular architecture of Taxol, synthetic organic chemists fiercely undertook efforts to synthesize it. Five total syntheses of Taxol have thus far been reported. Now, a combination of isolation of a related metabolite from European yew needles, and synthesis of Taxol from that intermediate, supply the clinical demand. This case clearly demonstrates the importance of synthesis and the use of organic chemistry.
