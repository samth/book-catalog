                        <span class="description">A new entry-level survey of cell biology that makes teaching and learning easier than ever before<br />
                            <br />
                            Saves work for teachers — motivates students<br />
                            <br />
                            Now a new introductory text explains cell biology at a level that is easy to grasp for students with a minimal knowledge of biology. The detailed, easy-to-follow text provides students with important background information and the basics necessary to understand cell biology. Teachers can spend less time explaining fundamentals and can focus on more sophisticated concepts. In addition, a profusion of detailed step-by-step full-color diagrams, electron micrographs and photographs reveal and clarify important principles and processes.<br />
                            <br />
                            Written by the authors of a renowned classic<br />
                            <br />
                            This new volume is the work of the same exceptional team who wrote the groundbreaking and universally acclaimed text Molecular Biology of the Cell, now in its Third Edition. The brand-new Essential Cell Biology was written in response to many professors who expressed a need for an introductory textbook for undergraduates that was not as difficult as texts for advanced undergraduate and graduate students. In Essential Cell Biology, early chapters review basic concepts in chemistry and biochemistry to provide the necessary understanding of the essential processes and mechanisms covered later in the text. The full-color schematics have been meticulously constructed specifically for students taking a basic course.<br />
                            — Problems and answers complement the text and stimulate the student's curiosity.<br />
                            — Quick questions within each chapter enable students to instantly review what they have just read.<br />
                            — End-of-chapter self-tests of more challenging questions letstudents gauge their grasp of the material and whet their appetite for more information.<br />
                            — Easy-to-understand panels illuminate the principles of microscopy, the composition of biological macromolecules, the basis of hydrophobicity, the glycolytic pathway, principles of genetics, and many more topics.<br />
                            — Lavish full-color art work and many color photographs and electron micrographs enliven and illustrate the text.<br />
                            — A detailed glossary helps students master the specialized vocabulary of modern biology.<br />
                            <br />
                            An easy-to-grasp introduction to cell biology<br />
                            <br />
                            The new text has been carefully geared to introductory students, without any sacrifice of scientific rigor. The book's conceptual approach, in which the essential facts are presented in their biological context, is ideal for engaging and motivating students new to molecular and cell biology. The book is written especially for undergraduates in biological sciences, but its content can be easily understood and absorbed by advanced high-school students who need a basic introduction to the essential topics in modern biology. Here are some of the highlights of the coverage:<br />
                            — A superb chapter on proteins takes students step by step from the basic construction of protein molecules to the construction of the protein machines that drive cellular processes.<br />
                            — Coverage of genetic variation and recombinant DNA technology offers students an easy-to-understand introduction to the techniques at the frontiers of biological research.<br />
                            — The text is enlivened and enriched throughout with examples of practical applications of the basic biological principles presented.<br />
                            — Explanations of cell biological processes also show at themolecular level how cancers can arise when the processes go out of control.<br />
                            — Fully up-to-date chapters on intracellular membrane traffic, the cytoskeleton, the cell cycle and signal transduction provide a state-of-the-art perspective on these cutting-edge fields at an introductory level.<br />
                            — All the illustrations are available on CD-ROM — enabling instructors to put together individualized presentations in just a few minutes.<br />
                            — A Test Bank offers multiple-choice and short-answer questions on each chapter.<br />

                        <span class="description">Originally Part II of Physical Chemistry, Second Edition, and now published as its own volume, Matter in Equilibrium: Statistical Mechanics and Thermodynamics simultaneously develops the statistical molecular theory and the classical thermodynamic theory of the bulk properties of matter in a mutually reinforcing fashion. Despite presenting both a microscopic and macroscopic approach, this sophisticated text offers a rigorous treatment of classical thermodynamics and allows professors to separate the two theories if desired. Packed with tables, graphs, and figures, it describes the equilibrium properties of bulk matter and develops the tools needed to study gases, solids, liquids, phase transformations, solutions of nonelectrolytes, and solutions of electrolytes. The book makes extensive use of computer simulations of molecular behavior and, where appropriate, uses experimental data to illustrate concepts and principles. Ideal for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate level courses, Matter in Equilibrium broadens and challenges student perspectives while offering valuable information to researchers.</span>

Nowhere is this more apparent than in the increasing efforts to determine the DNA sequence of the human genome and the development of new diagnostics of genetic disease. Recent sophistication of nucleic acids synthesis has been key to the establishment of the biotechnology industry and our improving knowledge of nucleic acid structures and interactions is noticeably influencing the design of novel drugs.This second and completely revised edition draws on the expertise of the same international group of authors to set the basics of the nucleic acids in the context of the expanding horizons set by modern structural biology, RNA enzymology, drug discovery and biotechnology.</span>

                        <span class="description">Calculus and linear algebra are two dominant themes in contemporary mathematics and its applications. The aim of this book is to introduce linear algebra in an intuitive geometric setting as the study of linear maps and to use these simpler linear functions to study more complicated nonlinear functions. In this way, many of the ideas, techniques, and formulas in the calculus of several variables are clarified and understood in a more conceptual way. After using this text a student should be well prepared for subsequent advanced courses in both algebra and linear differential equations as well as the many applications where linearity and its interplay with nonlinearity are significant. This second edition has been revised to clarify the concepts. Many exercises and illustrations have been included to make the text more usable for students.</span>

                        <span class="description">Intended for use in an introductory graduate course in theoretical computer science, this text contains material that should be core knowledge in the theory of computation for all graduates in computer science. It is self-contained and is best suited for a one semester course. The text starts with classical computability theory which forms the basis for complexity theory. This has the pedagogical advantage that students learn a qualitative subject before advancing to a quantitative one. Since this is a graduate course, students should have some knowledge of such topics as automata theory, formal languages, computability theory, or complexity theory.</span>

                        <span class="description">A type system is a syntactic method for automatically checking the absence of certain erroneous behaviors by classifying program phrases according to the kinds of values they compute. The study of type systems—and of programming languages from a type-theoretic perspective — -has important applications in software engineering, language design, high-performance compilers, and security.This text provides a comprehensive introduction both to type systems in computer science and to the basic theory of programming languages. The approach is pragmatic and operational; each new concept is motivated by programming examples and the more theoretical sections are driven by the needs of implementations. Each chapter is accompanied by numerous exercises and solutions, as well as a running implementation, available via the Web. Dependencies between chapters are explicitly identified, allowing readers to choose a variety of paths through the material.The core topics include the untyped lambda-calculus, simple type systems, type reconstruction, universal and existential polymorphism, subtyping, bounded quantification, recursive types, kinds, and type operators. Extended case studies develop a variety of approaches to modeling the features of object-oriented languages.</span>

This book offers accessible introductions to key ideas in the field, with contributions by experts on each topic.The topics covered include precise type analyses, which extend simple type systems to give them a better grip on the run time behavior of systems; type systems for low-level languages; applications of types to reasoning about computer programs; type theory as a framework for the design of sophisticated module systems; and advanced techniques in ML-style type inference.Advanced Topics in Types and Programming Languages builds on Benjamin Pierce's Types and Programming Languages (MIT Press, 2002); most of the chapters should be accessible to readers familiar with basic notations and techniques of operational semantics and type systems — the material covered in the first half of the earlier book.Advanced Topics in Types and Programming Languages can be used in the classroom and as a resource for professionals. Most chapters include exercises, ranging in difficulty from quick comprehension checks to challenging extensions, many with solutions.</span>

                        <span class="description">This best-selling text by John Taylor, now released in its second edition, introduces the study of uncertainties to lower division science students. Assuming no prior knowledge, the author introduces error analysis through the use of familiar examples ranging from carpentry to well-known historic experiments. Pertinent worked examples, simple exercises throughout the text, and numerous chapter-ending problems combine to make the book ideal for use in physics, chemistry, and engineering lab courses. The first edition of this book has been translated into six languages.</span>

                        <span class="description">Based on lectures given at Claremont McKenna College, this text constitutes a substantial, abstract introduction to linear algebra. The presentation emphasizes the structural elements over the computational - for example by connecting matrices to linear transformations from the outset - and prepares the student for further study of abstract mathematics. Uniquely among algebra texts at this level, it introduces group theory early in the discussion, as an example of the rigorous development of informal axiomatic systems.</span>

                        <span class="description">The Formal Semantics of Programming Languages provides the basic mathematical techniques necessary for those who are beginning a study of the semantics and logics of programming languages. These techniques will allow students to invent, formalize, and justify rules with which to reason about a variety of programming languages. Although the treatment is elementary, several of the topics covered are drawn from recent research, including the vital area of concurency. The book contains many exercises ranging from simple to miniprojects.<br />
                            <br />
                            Starting with basic set theory, structural operational semantics is introduced as a way to define the meaning of programming languages along with associated proof techniques. Denotational and axiomatic semantics are illustrated on a simple language of while-programs, and fall proofs are given of the equivalence of the operational and denotational semantics and soundness and relative completeness of the axiomatic semantics. A proof of Godel's incompleteness theorem, which emphasizes the impossibility of achieving a fully complete axiomatic semantics, is included. It is supported by an appendix providing an introduction to the theory of computability based on while-programs.<br />
                            <br />
                            Following a presentation of domain theory, the semantics and methods of proof for several functional languages are treated. The simplest language is that of recursion equations with both call-by-value and call-by-name evaluation. This work is extended to lan guages with higher and recursive types, including a treatment of the eager and lazy lambda-calculi. Throughout, the relationship between denotational and operational semantics is stressed, and the proofs of the correspondence between the operation and denotational semantics are provided. The treatment of recursive types - one of the more advanced parts of the book - relies on the use of information systems to represent domains. The book concludes with a chapter on parallel programming languages, accompanied by a discussion of methods for specifying and verifying nondeterministic and parallel programs.</span>
