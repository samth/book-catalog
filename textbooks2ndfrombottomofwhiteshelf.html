An enzyme is a protein molecule in a plant or animal that causes specific reactions without itself being permanently altered or destroyed.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                This is a revised edition of a very successful book, which appeals to both academic and industrial markets.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Illustrates the organic mechanism associated with each enzyme-catalyzed reaction<br />
                                                Makes the connection between organic reaction mechanisms and enzyme mechanisms<br />
                                                Compiles the latest information about molecular mechanisms of enzyme reactions<br />
                                                Accompanied by clearly drawn structures, schemes, and figures<br />
                                                Includes an extensive bibliography on enzyme mechanisms covering the last 30 years<br />
                                                Explains how enzymes can accelerate the rates of chemical reactions with high specificity<br />
                                                Provides approaches to the design of inhibitors of enzyme-catalyzed reactions<br />
                                                Categorizes the cofactors that are appropriate for catalyzing different classes of reactions<br />
                                                Shows how chemical enzyme models are used for mechanistic studies<br />
                                                Describes catalytic antibody design and mechanism<br />

                                            <span class="description">Semantics of Programming Languages exposes the basic motivations and philosophy underlying the applications of semantic techniques in computer science. It introduces the mathematical theory of programming languages with an emphasis on higher-order functions and type systems. Designed as a text for upper-level and graduate-level students, the mathematically sophisticated approach will also prove useful to professionals who want an easily referenced description of fundamental results and calculi.Basic connections between computational behavior, denotational semantics, and the equational logic of functional programs are thoroughly and rigorously developed. Topics covered include models of types, operational semantics, category theory, domain theory, fixed point (denotational). semantics, full abstraction and other semantic correspondence criteria, types and evaluation, type checking and inference, parametric polymorphism, and subtyping. All topics are treated clearly and in depth, with complete proofs for the major results and numerous exercises.</span>

Biological Physics focuses on new results in molecular motors, self-assembly, and single-molecule manipulation that have revolutionized the field in recent years, and integrates these topics with classical results. The text also provides foundational material for the emerging field of nanotechnology. The text is built around a self-contained core geared toward undergraduate students who have had one year of calculus-based physics. Additional "Track-2" sections contain more advanced material for senior physics majors and graduate students.</span>

This classic book has been thoroughly revised to provide readable coverage of the major programming paradigms. Dr. Sethi's treatment of the core concepts of imperative programming in languages like Pascal and C flows smoothly into object-oriented programming in C++ and Smalltalk. The charm of functional languages is illustrated by programs in standard ML and the Scheme dialect of Lisp. Logic programming is introduced using Prolog. Novices, who have been introduced to programming in some language, will learn from this book how related concepts work together while designers and implementers willp be exposed to the major programming paradigms. Example programs from the book are available as source code. These are available by anonymous ftp at ftp://ftp.aw.com/cseng/authors/sethi/pl2e. 0201590654B04062001</span>
