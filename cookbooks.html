                                            <span class="description">With his million-copy bestseller How to Cook Everything, Mark Bittman made the difficult doable. Now he makes the exotic accessible.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                In this highly ambitious, accomplished, globe-spanning work, Bittman gathers the best recipes that people from dozens of countries around the world cook every day. And when he brings his distinctive no-frills approach to dishes that were once considered esoteric, America's home cooks will eagerly follow where they once feared to tread.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                In more than a thousand recipes, Bittman compellingly demonstrates that there are many places besides Italy and France to which cooks can turn for inspiration. In addition to these favorites, he covers Spain, Portugal, Greece, Russia, Scandinavia, the Balkans, Germany, and other European destinations, giving us easy ways to make dishes like Spanish Mushroom and Chicken Paella, Greek Roast Leg of Lamb with Thyme and Orange, Russian Borscht, and Swedish Äppletorte.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Asian food now rivals European cuisine’s popularity, and this book reflects that: It’s the first to emphasize European and Asian cuisines equally, with easy-to-follow recipes for favorites like Vietnamese Stir-Fried Vegetables with Nam Pla, Pad Thai, Japanese Salmon Teriyaki, Chinese Black Bean and Garlic Spareribs, and Indian Tandoori Chicken. Nor is the rest of the world ignored: there are hundreds of recipes from North Africa, the Middle East, and Central and South America, too. All will be hits with home cooks looking to add exciting new tastes and cosmopolitan flair to their everyday repertoire.<br />
                                                <br />

                                            <span class="description">Here is the great basic American cookbook—with more than 1,990 recipes, plain and fancy—that belongs in every household.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Originally published in 1896 as The Boston Cooking-School Cook Book by Fannie Merritt Farmer, it became the coobook that taught generations of Americans how to cook. Completely updating it for the first time since 1979, Marion Cunningham made Fannie Farmer once again a household word for a new generation of cooks.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                What makes this basic cookbook so distinctive is that Marion Cunningham, who is the personification of the nineteenth-century teacher, is always at your side with her forthright tips and comments, encouraging the beginning cook and inspiring the more adventurous. She knows what today's cooks are looking for, and she has a way of instilling confidence and joy in the act of cooking.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                In giving the book new life, Mrs. Cunningham has been careful always to preserve the best of the old. She has retained all the particularly good, tried-and-true recipes from preceding editions, retesting and rewriting when necessary. She has rediscovered lost treasures, including delicious recipes that were eliminated when practically no one baked bread at home. This is now the place to find the finest possible recipes for Pumpkin Soup, Boston Baked Beans, Carpetbag Steak, Roast Stuffed Turkey, Anadama Bread, Indian Pudding, Apple Pie, and all of the other traditional favorites.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                The new recipes reflect ethnic influences—Mediterranean, Moroccan, Asian—that have been adding their flavors to American cooking in recent years. Tucked in among all your favorites like Old-Fashioned Beef Stew, New England Clam Chowder, Ham Timbales, and Chicken Jambalaya, you'll find her cool Cucumber Sushi, Enchiladas with Chicken and Green Sauce, or a layered dish of Polenta and Fish to add variety to your repertoire. Always a champion of old-fashioned breakfasts and delectable desserts, Mrs. Cunningham has many splendid new offerings to tempt you.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Throughout, cooking terms and procedures are explained, essential ingredients are spelled out, basic equipment is assessed. Mrs. Cunningham even tells you how to make a good cup of coffee and how to brew tea properly.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                For the diet-conscious, there is an expanded nutritional chart that includes a breakdown of cholesterol and fat in common ingredients as well as in Fannie Farmer basic recipes. Where the taste of a dish would not be altered, Mrs. Cunningham has reduced the amount of cream and butter in some of the recipes from the preceding edition. She carefully evaluates the issues of food safety today and alerts us to potential hazards.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                But the emphasis here is always on good flavor, fresh ingredients, and lots of variety in one's daily fare, which Marion Cunningham believes is the secret to a healthy diet. Dedicated to the home cooks of America, young and old, this thirteenth edition of the book that won the hearts of Americans more than a century ago invites us all—as did the original Fannie Farmer—to cherish the delights of the family table.</span>

                                            <span class="description">What Julia Child is to French cooking and Marcella Hazan is to Italian cooking, Deborah Madison is to contemporary vegetarian cooking.  At Greens restaurant in San Francisco, where she was the founding chef, and in her two acclaimed vegetarian cookbooks, Madison elevated vegetarian cooking to new heights of sophistication, introducing many people to the joy of cooking without meat, whether occasionally or for a lifetime.  But after her many years as a teacher and writer, she realized that there was no comprehensive primer for vegetarian cooking, no single book that taught vegetarians basic cooking techniques, how to combine ingredients, and how to present vegetarian dishes with style.  Now, in a landmark cookbook that has been six years in the making, Madison teaches readers how to build flavor into vegetable dishes, how to develop vegetable stocks, and how to choose, care for, and cook the many vegetables available to cooks today.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone is the most comprehensive vegetarian cookbook ever published.  The 1,400 recipes, which range from appetizers to desserts, are colorful and imaginative as well as familiar and comforting.  Madison introduces readers to innovative main course salads; warm and cold soups; vegetable braises and cobblers; golden-crusted gratins; Italian favorites like pasta, polenta, pizza, and risotto; savory tarts and galettes; grilled sandwiches and quesadillas; and creative dishes using grains and heirloom beans.  At the heart of the book is the A-to-Z vegetable chapter, which describes the unique personalities of readily available vegetables, the sauces and seasonings that best complement them, and the simplest ways to prepare them.  "Becoming a Cook" teaches cooking basics, from holding a knife to planning a menu, and "Foundations of Flavor" discusses how to use sauces, herbs, spices, oils, and vinegars to add flavor and character to meatless dishes.  In each chapter, the recipes range from those suitable for everyday dining to dishes for special occasions.  And through it all, Madison presents a philosophy of cooking that is both practical and inspiring.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Despite its focus on meatless cooking, Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone is not just for vegetarians: It's for everyone interested in learning how to cook vegetables creatively, healthfully, and passionately.  The recipes are remarkably straightforward, using easy-to-find ingredients in inspiring combinations.  Some are simple, others more complex, but all are written with an eye toward the seasonality of produce.  And Madison's joyful and free-spirited approach to cooking will send you into the kitchen with confidence and enthusiasm.  Whether you are a kitchen novice or an experienced cook, this wonderful cookbook has something for everyone.</span>

The editors of Vegetarian Times magazine, the leading authorities on the vegetarian lifestyle, have compiled this delicious collection of 150 recipes, all of which can be prepared in 30 minutes or less. In fact, many of the recipes are easy enough to complete in just 15 or 20 minutes.<br />
                                                <br />

Of course, eating meatless meals is always healthful, but, as the Vegetarian Times editors explain, you still need to watch what you eat to stay fit and healthy. Light vegetarian cooking can be made simple by cutting back on eggs, using low-fat cheeses, sauteing with olive oil instead of butter, and trying healthy cooking techniques like grilling, broiling, roasting, and steaming, all of which bring out the best flavors in your food.<br />
                                                <br />

Vegetarian Times Low-Fat and Fast is a timesaving cookbook that will make anyone, even beginner cooks, feel at home in the kitchen.<br />

From new takes on classics like chicken soup with herbed dumplings and Tuscan minestrone to innovations like butternut bisque with Gruyere croutons and Hanoi beef noodle soup, ENLIGHTENED SOUPS is filled with choices for any day of the week, any time of the year. Like all of the books in the Enlightened Cooking series, the recipes are straightforward, the ingredients commonly available, and the techniques geared toward the home cook. Every recipe includes a nutritional analysis, and at the back of the book, quick-search appendixes indicate which soups are especially low in fat (fewer than 3 grams per serving), especially low in calories (150 or less per serving), and especially low in total time required (from start to finish). The recipes are divided into pureed, meat, poultry, seafood, vegetable, and legume soups.</span>

With Vegetarian Times Low-Fat &amp; Fast Asian, Asian food lovers can have their favorite dishes without the fat. Low-Fat &amp; Fast Asian will be the first cookbook of its kind — a collection of all meatless Asian dishes. As with other books in this series, every dish will be easy enough to prepare in 20 to 30 minutes and will include a complete nutritional breakdown. Our on-going series with Vegetarian Times magazine includes Vegetarian Times Complete Cookbook, Vegetarian Times Beginner's Guide, and Vegetarian Times Vegetarian Entertaining.</span>
