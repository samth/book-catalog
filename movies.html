Part of the program's enduring appeal is its unique premise: police investigate an urban crime during the first half, and prosecutors work the resulting trial during the second half. Meet, for the first time, detective Mike Logan (Chris North), assistant district DA Ben Stone (Michael Moriarty), their colleagues, and the crooks who keep them busy. Over 17-1/4 hours on 6 DVDs.</span>

Told from the point of view of both the police and their targets, the series captures a universe of subterfuge and surveillance, where easy distinctions between good and evil, and crime and punishment, are challenged at every turn.</span>

In a sudden, devastating nuclear attack, the Cylon robots - who have now taken human form - wipe out billions of people. Only a handful of Colonial forces are left to shepherd the few survivors to safety. Commander William Adama (Edward James Olmos), the highest-ranking military officer left alive, reactivates the Battlestar Galactica to once again face humanity's greatest nemeses.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Outnumbered and outarmed, Adama reluctantly concedes that the newly sworn-in President Laura Roslin (Mary McDonnell) is correct - this battle was lost before it had begun. With no choice but to flee, the ragtag fleet of survivors and humanity's only hope set out in search of the mythic 13th Colony of Kobol… a legendary planet known as Earth.</span>
